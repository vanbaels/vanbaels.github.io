::: {#svb-summary}
Hi!

I’m a former (post)doctoral researcher at KU Leuven/University of Antwerp with a strong interest in **data science and data visualization**. During my academic career, I have gained a lot of experience with critically analysing relatively large datasets and applying statistical methods to turn raw data into meaningful conclusions.

On this website I have collected some of my work using **R and RStudio**. This ranges from personal projects based on my own interests and curiosity, to some of my academic work, where I used R to answer some of my research questions.

**Want to know more about me?** Check the left pane of this page. You can contact me via mail, or explore my CV and list of academic publications.
