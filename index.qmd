::: {#svb-summary}
Hi!

I’m a former (post)doctoral researcher at KU Leuven/University of Antwerp with a strong interest in **data science and data visualization**. During my academic career, I have gained a lot of experience with critically analyzing large data sets and applying statistical methods to turn raw data into meaningful conclusions.

On this website I have collected some of my work with **R, RStudio and Quarto**. This ranges from [personal projects](Personal_projects/personal_projects.qmd) based on my own interests and curiosity, to some of my [academic work](Academic_work/academic_work.qmd), where I used R to answer some of my research questions.

**Want to know more about me?** You can contact me via mail, or explore my CV and list of academic publications on this page.
